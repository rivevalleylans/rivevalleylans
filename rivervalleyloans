Bluevine is a fintech company offering high-yield checking accounts as well as unsecured lines of credit for established small businesses. You can access its revolving credit line as many times as you need, replenishing the available credit as you pay down past withdrawals.

Why Bluevine is the best for LLC line of credit: Bluevine offers a speedy online application process and a seamless online dashboard for your line of credit. Once approved, you can withdraw funds and get them deposited to your bank account within 24 hours. You can borrow up to $250,000, choosing between a six- or 12-month term. You can also choose between weekly or monthly payments, unlike some lines of credit that only allow you to repay weekly. Well-qualified and well-established borrowers may enjoy a low starting interest rate.

Who Bluevine is good for: Bluevine is ideal for LLCs that have been around for at least two years and have a high level of revenue. It offers lines of credit to businesses with at least $40,000 in monthly revenue for six-month repayment terms and $80,000 monthly for 12-month terms. These are stricter requirements than what most lenders set. Bluevine may also work well if your LLC wants to combine banking and lending services, helping you manage your accounts in one place.
