Overview: The fintech lender Funding Circle blends the convenience of an online application with the personal touch of assigning a dedicated account manager to review your financing needs. The company offers small business lines of credit and SBA 7(a) loans in addition to their business term loans.

Why Funding Circle is the best for building business credit: Loan payments are reported to credit bureaus Experian and Dun & Bradstreet, so on-time payments can help grow your business credit score. Its loans also offer long repayment terms to business owners, which can help make loan payments more manageable. Its repayment terms stretch from six months to seven years.

Who Funding Circle is good for: Funding Circle works well for businesses with solid personal credit scores of at least 660. It does welcome low-revenue businesses down to $50,000 per year, an unusually low standard for any lender.
